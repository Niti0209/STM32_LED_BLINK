Installing STM32CubeIDE:
Link: https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html
Step1: Register and create an account on the link first.
Step2: Login with the credentials.
Step3: Select the download link per the computer's OS after logging in. Accept the license agreement and .exe file will be downloaded.
Step4: Extract the file contents and allow the installation to continue and complete.
Step5: Select a directory as the workspace and allow the application to run. 
Step6: Open the workspace. First we need to login to the ST account. 
Help -> STM32Cube Update -> Connection to myST.
Window opens, enter your credentials.
Step7: After logging in successfully, create a project.
File -> New -> STM32 Project.
Step8: Select the board selector option. Commercial Part number is the name of the board that we are using.
Step9: Type the project name. Don’t use blank spaces in the name. then, click finish.
Project 1: Onboard LED Blinking.
In this IDE, code is always written in between the appropriate comments. Anything written outside the comment gets erased whenever the code is regenerated or opened again. 
Step10: Select the configuration of the required GPIO pins. STM32 board has 50 GPIO pins. 
HAL – Hardware Abstraction Layer.
Step11: Open the main.c file and make the required changes in the code.
Changes made: while loop()
HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, GPIO_PIN_SET);
HAL_Delay(5);
HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
HAL_Delay(5);
This code will set the onboard led for 500ms and reset it for 500ms. 
Step12: Use the build option to build the project. Then run the project to see the output.
